**Quazbut's Bash Arcade Games**

A collection of arcade games created in bash script because no-one ever told
me I shouldn't. I spent many hours creating and testing these as a challenge
and some therapy for shitty mental and physical health. Depression and pain
sucks balls. Released to the world to maybe make someone else smile, or yell
in frustration. Have fun.

**Current line up:**
*Blaster* - Vertical scrolling space shooter.
*Robot Deathmatch* - Remake of the classic robot chase game, now with shrubs.

Requires some features introduced in Bash v4.2 or thereabouts, if my sources
are correct. Testing was done on an up-to-date local Debian minimal install and
a remote server running bullseye, with bash v5.x on both.

If you're reading this, it is assumed you know how to make a file executable
and run it. If you find any bugs fix 'em yourself.

As at 29-Apr-2025 there are a couple more in the planning stage. Maybe I'll start
them, maybe I'll finish them. Time will tell.
